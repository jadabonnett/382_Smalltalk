# 382_Smalltalk

## Reasoning ##
This was done in order to become more familiar with object oriented paradigms and discover how they work and how best to use them. Through this we took an already established class and then we added in new ones to new fucntionality. This also helped me become with Smalltalk as a whole and it's environemnt of Pharo.

## Problems ##
Created numerous new classes which included:

**sum:** - returns polynomial of sum of self and object handed to it\
**evaluate:** - returns polynomial that was evaluated from the given parameter\
**evaluate** - displays prompt window to input value which then returns a polynomial of that value\
**differentiate** - returns derivative of polynomial\
**graphFrom:graphTo:** - plots polymoial over given range

## Usability ##
I used this in an enviroment called Pharo in which then in testing of the new classes you were able to 'call' these by using the below.
